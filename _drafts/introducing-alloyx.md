#### Millennials Don't Buy Gold

Millennials don't buy gold. Ask one at a coffee shop sometime. They will say they've never even thought about it. And yet, millennials are probably the most sophisticated financial generation ever. In the same breath, they will understand and talk about how gold makes a great hedge.

So why don't they buy gold?

#### It Is Difficult

It is way too difficult. I should know. I'm a millennial, and I've tried. It's easier to purchase obscure cryptocurrencies like dogecoin, than it is to invest in gold.

* It's slow
* It's expensive
* It's inconvenient

First, you must save up almost $1,300.00. That is more than a share of GOOG! Even if you have a good job, it is not easy to save up that much money. Not to mention, the price of gold might increase while you are saving that money, costing you more money.

When you have finally saved that much, you have only 2 options for purchasing investment-grade gold bars.

1. Physically visit a gold shop
2. Navigate archaic e-commerce websites

##### Gold shop

If you choose the shop option, you have to withdraw $1,300.00 in cash and carry it on your person. Many shops will not accept a debit card payment. And when they do, they will hold your bar for a week (or more) while the payment fully clears. So now you're left waiting another week for your gold bar and paying another visit to the shop. Finally, shops have higher fees because they have high overhead, like rent, to pay.

##### E-commerce website



Buying gold requqires multi-day payment approval times and multi-day delivery times. Sometimes it drags into a week or more. Then you must save $1,300, up front, to purchase a standard 1oz bar. You must physically visit a shop or navigate archaic e-commerce sites.

This isn't right. Investing in a hedge for your investments should be as easy as investing in your other investments. Investing in a straightforward investment like gold should be equally straightforward.

So I went to work on a solution. Something that would be fast, affordable, and effortless.

#### It could be easier

#### Now it is easier
