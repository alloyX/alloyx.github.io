#### Millennials Don't Buy Gold

Millennials don't buy gold. Ask one at a coffee shop sometime. They will say they've never even thought about it. And yet, millennials are probably the most sophisticated financial generation ever. In the same breath, they will understand and talk about how gold makes a great hedge.

So why don't they buy gold?

#### It Is Too Difficult

It is way too difficult. I should know. I'm a millennial, and I've tried. It's easier to purchase obscure cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, than it is to invest in gold.

* It's slow
* It's expensive
* It's inconvenient

First, you must save up almost $1,300.00. That is more than a share of GOOG! Even if you have a good job, it is not easy to save up that much money. Not to mention, the price of gold might increase while you are saving that money, costing you more money.

When you have finally saved that much, you have only 2 options for purchasing investment-grade gold bars.

1. Physically visit a gold shop
2. Navigate archaic e-commerce websites

##### Physically visit a gold shop

If you choose the shop option, you have to withdraw $1,300.00 in cash and carry it on your person. Many shops will not accept a debit card payment. And when they do, they will hold your bar for a week (or more) while the payment fully clears. So now you're left waiting another week for your gold bar and paying another visit to the shop. Finally, shops have higher fees because they have high overhead, like rent, to pay.

##### Navigate archaic e-commerce websites

If you choose the e-commerce option, you will be bombarded with options. Thousands of different products. Bars, rounds, secondary markets, collectibles, holiday-themed coins, gold grain, etc. Navigation is bad, and the majority of the options are designed to make the website more money rather than help you invest in gold. Once you do find investment-grade bars at a good price, you still have to go through the payment process. 

Many gold e-commerce sites do not accept credit cards. If they do, they typically charge an additional 4% or greater fee. To avoid that fee, you have two options, pay by check or a wire. Yes, literally mail a check. Do you even have checks? This will cost you a lot of time too. Once the check does arrive, which could take days in the mail, then the e-commerce store will hold it for another 4 days (or more) to verify payment. Alternatively, you can pay by wire but this often requires calling up your bank, configuring the wire details (don't get them wrong or your money is gone forever), and paying $20-$40 just to send the wire.

##### Do you see how difficult this is?

The process is terribly difficult. It takes days to weeks. There is no app. There is no automation. There is no modernity.

It shouldn't be this way. Investing in a hedge for your investments should be as easy as investing in your other investments. Gold is a straightforward investment, investing in it should be too.



So I went to work on a solution. Something that would be fast, affordable, and effortless.
