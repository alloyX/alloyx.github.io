Millennials don't buy gold.

Ask one on the street, sometime. They will say they've never even thought about it.

And yet, millennials are probably the most sophisticated financial generation ever. In the same breath, they will understand and talk about how gold makes a great hedge.

So why don't they buy gold?

Because it is too difficult.

I should know. I'm a millennial, and I've tried.

It's easier to purchase obscure cryptocurrencies like dogecoin, than it is to invest in gold.

It's slow. Multi-day payment approval times and multi-day delivery times. Sometimes it drags into a week or more.

It's expensive. You must save $1,300, up front, to purchase a standard 1oz bar. 

It's inconvenient. You must physically visit a shop or navigate archaic e-commerce sites.

This isn't right. Investing in a hedge for your investments should be as easy as investing in your other investments. Investing in a straightforward investment like gold should be equally straightforward.

So I went to work on a solution. Something that would be fast, affordable, and effortless.
